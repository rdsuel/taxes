Basic tax calculations using python. My goal is to be able to calculate my paycheck programmatically and see how various adjustments will impact takehome pay, etc.

## Example Output (gradually adding more functionality)
Current output from the `example.py` file using an example salary of $100,000. Example uses 2018 married filing joint federal tax bracket and the 2018 KY income tax bracket. Deductions are not yet handled ... they're coming next.
